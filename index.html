      <h2>About the Owner</h2>
      <p>Justin High is the owner and head instructor at Gracie 717 North in Halifax, PA. He grew up wrestling on farms, brawling in schoolyards, and eventually competing at a high level in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. With a background that includes MMA training, collegiate education in exercise physiology, and real-world experience working security at top-tier nightclubs across the country, Justin brings a gritty, disciplined, and authentic presence to every class he teaches.</p>

      <p>Under the mentorship of Damione Puopolo at Gracie 717, Justin sharpened his craft and developed a relentless competitive edge. He's competed against athletes from around the globe, earning five IBJJF world titles and a reputation for consistent performance, technical precision, and unmatched intensity. In 2022, he also began competing in ultramarathons, placing in the top 10 in each of his first three races.</p>

      <p>Today, Justin continues to train, compete, and teach with the same focus that’s carried him through adversity and triumph. As a brown belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, he leads from the front—challenging his students to build discipline, trust the grind, and earn everything through hard work and grit.</p>
